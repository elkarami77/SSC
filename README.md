# Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) algorithms

This repository contains Matlab code to implement ADMM and proximal gradient algorithms to solve the SSC clustering problem (several variants, including variants for affine subspaces). The SSC model we work with is based on the well-known work of [Elhamifar and Vidal's Sparse "Subspace Clustering: Algorithm, Theory, and Applications" (IEEE Trans. on PAMI)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7262850065108933522&hl=en&as_sdt=0,6&as_vis=1)

The new code is much faster, as it scales like *O(n^2)* instead of *O(n^3)*
